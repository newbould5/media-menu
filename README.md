# media-menu
Mac menu bar application showing current spotify/sonos track.

## What does it do
This app lives in the menu bar of your mac. It will show you which song is currently playing on
spotify or your sonos speaker. A popup player for playback control can be used by clicking on the icon.

### Spotify
Spotify works out of the box. The only requirement is that the application is running.

### Sonos
To enable sonos you first need to install [SoCo-cli](https://github.com/avantrec/soco-cli). After
that go to preferences and type the name of your speaker. If you installed Soco-cli somewhere else
you can also change the path to the binary. Once the setup is completed you can enable the sonos
integration.

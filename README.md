# media-menu
Mac menu bar application showing current spotify track.

## What does it do
This app lives in the menu bar of your mac. There are two 'modes', basic and advanced.

### Advanced
With the advanced mode you will be able to control spotify playback right from the menu bar. When you click on the media-menu icon a pop-up will show with all the controls.
Advanced mode will now automatically show the current track in the menu bar if a song is playing and show the icon when pauzed or spotify is not running.

### Basic
The basic mode will show you the current track right in your menu bar. Just click the icon and it will be displayed.
